My First Project with HTML & CSS

Welcome to my first project where I've built a website using HTML and CSS! As I work through The Odin Project, this project is helping me solidify my understanding of front-end fundamentals. It has been a great hands-on experience, and I’m continuously building on my skills in HTML and CSS.

This project reflects my progress as I develop a strong foundation in web development, and I’m excited to keep improving as I tackle more complex challenges in the future.
